## Installation

To install this package in your local Python-environment:

1. clone this repository from github
2. Install from the repository root using pip: `pip install .`
3. Or in editable mode (so edits are immediately reflected): `pip install -e .`

## Contributing

If you want to make an edit to this package:

1. Clone this repository from github (or pull latest version if already cloned).
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name for the change you want to make.
3. Edit the package until you are satisfied with the result.
4. Commit your changes to the branch you created (commit quick and often, and use descriptive commit messages)
5. Push everything to the Github repository
6. Create a pull request on Github, requesting to merge your branch with the main branch. Another person can then review the changes you have made, propose improvements, and accept them when everything is satisfactory.

The reviewing of pull requests is important to ensure that nothing is broken by the changes that you make. It also creates a nice opportunity to learn from somebody else how they would have approached the same edits.

## On acknowledgement of performed work

By following the proper commit guidelines, any commit, or pull request (basically a collection of commits) will both describe the work you have done (from the commit messages) and actually show what you have done on a per line! basis. With this approach, multiple people can accurately take credit for the work they have done on a shared software package.
