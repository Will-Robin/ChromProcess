# ChromProcess

**Experimental branch!**

> This branch contains code written in Rust (via `pyo3`) to replace some
> dependencies, giving `ChromProcess` a partner, `chromate`. The code here
> requires Rust and Cargo to be installed, as well as maturin. To build during
> development: `maturin develop`/`maturin develop --release`

Python tools to deal with sets of chromatography data.

ChromProcess aims to provide a set of tools to aid in developing data processing
pipelines for efficient and reproducible data analysis.

## Installation

Please see `installation.md`.

## Documentation

Examples for general use of ChromProcess are given in Jupyter notebooks in the
Tutorials directory (`Tutorials/ChromProcess_Introduction_1.ipynb` and
`Tutorials/ChromProcess_Introduction_2.ipynb`). They offer a basis upon which to
build an analysis workflow.

More detailed documentation of the code is supplied
[here](https://will-robin.github.io/ChromProcess/index.html).
