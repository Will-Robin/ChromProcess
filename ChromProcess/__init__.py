# ChromProcess

ChromProcess is a library of Python code which can be used to build automated
chromatography data analysis workflows.

For example usage of ChromProcess, see the `Tutorials` folder in the
repository. The examples given are one possible analysis workflow, and you can
build your own using ChromProcess as a library, which can be explored in these
docs.

Structures for data are found in ChromProcess.Classes. Using ChromProcess is
centred around the data contained in these objects. The general idea behind the
directory structure is that when one wants to *Load* a *chromatogram* from a
*text* format file, the code can be found in `Loading/chromatogram/text`, and
so on.

This documentation was generated from the ChromProcess source files using
[pdoc](https://pdoc.dev).
