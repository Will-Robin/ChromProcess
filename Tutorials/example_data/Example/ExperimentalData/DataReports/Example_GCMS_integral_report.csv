Derivatisation_method,Reaction samples (35 μL) were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and freeze-dried overnight to give dry to oily residues. To each sample was added a solution of O-ethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride in pyridine (75 μL; 20 g L^−1^). A solution of dodecane and tetradecane (100 μL; 1.6 mM each in pyridine) was then added to each sample. The samples were then shaken at 70 °C for 30 minutes. After cooling to room temperature; N;O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (25 μL) was added to each sample. The samples were again shaken at 70 °C for 30 minutes. The samples were then cooled to room temperature; followed by centrifugation (3-5 min; 10;000 rpm). The supernatants were decanted into sample vials for analysis by GC-MS.
